"""Regression tests for GLiNER training-data span correctness and windowing.

Locks in two fixes:

* ``_clean_items`` must keep token spans INCLUSIVE (no ``+ 1``). GLiNER 0.2.x
  builds candidate spans as ``(start, start + width)`` with ``width`` starting at
  0, so a single-token entity at token ``i`` is the inclusive span ``(i, i)`` and
  the gold lookup is an exact tuple match. A ``+ 1`` trains the model one token
  too wide and silently drops any entity ending on the last token — collapsing
  exact-F1 to ~0.
* ``_window_example`` must trim long records to bounded, span-centred windows
  while preserving multi-span grouping and realigning both token and character
  spans exactly.
